# Biography

I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Collaborative Haptics and Robotics in Medicine (CHARM) Lab at Stanford University. My research focus is on human-robot interaction and collaboration, with application in mobile robots and surgical robots.

Through my research and course work, I've developed a broad range of skills includingÂ robot controls, motion planning, artificial intelligence, machine learning, mechatronics and embedded systems. I'm passionate about bringing robotic technologies into daily life.

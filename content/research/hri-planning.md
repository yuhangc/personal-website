summary = "In order to function seamlessly in human environment, robots need to interact and communication with people. My thesis aims to enable robots to pro-actively communicate with users to improve efficiency and performance. I'm interested in designing new interaction schemes with wearable technologies (haptics, AR/VR), as well as intelligent algorithms that predict human behaviors and generate optimal plans."
